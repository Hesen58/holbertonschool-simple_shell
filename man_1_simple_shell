.SH HISTORY
.B hsh
is based on the Thompson Shell's program(sh) written by Ken Thompson in 1971. It was a simple command interpreter, not designed for scripting, butnonetheless introduced several innovative features to the command-line interface and led to the development of the later Unix shells.

.SH BUGS
This shell doesn't handle relative path, neither how error messages will apear when trying. Special characters, redirections and piping also won't work.
